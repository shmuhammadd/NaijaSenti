## Welcome!

This is a repository for SentiNaija Project, a [Lacuna Fund](https://lacunafund.org) funded project for development of sentiments corpus for three major Nigerian languages (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba). Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## The problem

Sentiment analysis (SA) is a field of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with the identification and classification of people’s opinions, sentiments and emotion  in a piece of text. There are many language resources in the research community for SA. However, most of them are for English, Chinese, and European languages. To the best of our knowledge, no any existing publicly available sentiment coprus in these languages. 

## Language Resource Developed

We take the first step to break this digital divide by creating open-source sentiment corpus in the three languages supported by [Lacuna Fund](https://lacunafund.org). We are developing the following resources:

 * The first large Scale Twitter Corpus for Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. This corpus can be use for any other Natural Language Processing downstream tasks.
 
 * The first large scale manually annotated Twitter Sentiment Corpus for Igbo (SentiIgbo), Hausa(SentiHausa) and Yoruba (SentiYoruba).
 
 * The first large scale manually annotated sentiment lexicon for Igbo (IgboSentiLex), Hausa (HausaSentiLex) and Yoruba(YorubaSentiLex).

 * The first large scale manually annotated hate speech lexicon for Igbo(IgboHateLex), Hausa (HausaHateLex) and Yoruba(YorubaHateLex)
 
  * The first large scale semi-automatic devloped sentiment lexicon for Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba.  
  
  * The first large scale semi-automatic emotion lexicon for Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba.
  
  * The first large scale manually annotated code-mixed tweets for Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba.
  * Semi-automatic development of stop-words in Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba language

## Papers from this project

We have not yet published any paper. We are currently working on data curation and annotation
